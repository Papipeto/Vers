A Worms like developed in Javascript

### Current state
#### V0.1
* The field is generated using cardinal splines. You can find the source of my inspiration here: [epistemex/cardinal-spline-js](https://github.com/epistemex/cardinal-spline-js).
I will try to find an easiest solution later (I'm currently forced to make my worms move too fast because of some clipping in my curve).
* The worm can move, aim, change direction.

### Todo
* Adding textures
* Make the worm jump!
* Basic weapon (other weapons later?)
* Damage the field
* Multiplayer offline
* Multiplayer online

Feel free to suggest me improvements ;)
