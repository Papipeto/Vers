A Worms like developed in Javascript

#### Current version: V0.22

### Notes
#### V0.22: Graphics are important too!

* I've added some basic (still awesome) graphics.

#### V0.21: Let the battle begin!
* The worm can now shoot (kind of...). Only straight shots for now, parabolic ones are incoming.
* The shot detect when it hits the floor or the limits of the canvas.

#### V0.2: The worm is now a thing!

* The worm can move, aim, change direction, jump. Yippee-ki-yay!

#### V0.1: The battlefield is ready!
* The field is generated using cardinal splines. You can find the source of my inspiration here: [epistemex/cardinal-spline-js](https://github.com/epistemex/cardinal-spline-js). It still has some clipping issues (the generated curve is duplicated and half of it values are wrong. Have to clean this)

### Todo
* ~~Randomize worm position (and make it point to the center when it spawns)~~
* Adding textures
* ~~Make the worm jump!~~
* Handle steepness (the works can currently climb everything)
* Basic weapon (other weapons later?)
* Damage the field
* Multiplayer offline
* Multiplayer online

Feel free to suggest me improvements ;)
